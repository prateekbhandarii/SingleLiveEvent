# SingleLiveEvent

A demonstration of how to make global events which can be observed anywhere across the application when posted with values. 
The observer should be active, i.e. the Fragment/Activity in which we observe the event should have active lifecycle.

# Step 1: 
Simply use postValue() function to setup the event.

# step 2:
Observe the values anywhere in the app.
